## ðŸ“¦ Project Structure

The `.kit` directory structure:

```bash
.kit/
â”œâ”€â”€ HEAD                # Points to the current branch or commit
â”œâ”€â”€ objects/            # Stores file snapshots and commits
â”œâ”€â”€ refs/               # Stores references to branches
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ heads/          # Stores branch heads
â””â”€â”€ stash/              # Stores stashed changes
```

---

## ðŸ§ª Tech Stack

- **C++17** â€“ Modern C++ for clean and efficient code.
- **CMake** â€“ Build system for cross-platform compatibility.
- **cxxopts** â€“ Lightweight CLI parser.
- **Filesystem API** â€“ For file and directory operations.
- **(Future)** OpenSSL or Crypto++ â€“ For hashing and encryption.

## ðŸ‘€ Goals

- Learn Git internals.
- Write a clean version control system.
- Play with low-level file I/O, hashing, and DAGs.

## ðŸ›  Planned Features

### `kit log`
- Display the commit history in reverse chronological order.
- Show commit hashes, messages, and timestamps.

### `.kit` Structure
- Implement a robust `.kit/objects` directory for storing file snapshots and commits.
- Use a `HEAD` file to track the current branch or commit.

### `kit stash`
- Temporarily save changes in the working directory.
- Allow users to apply or drop stashed changes.

### `kit branch`
- Create, list, and delete branches.
- Store branch references in `.kit/refs/heads`.

### `kit checkout`
- Switch between branches or specific commits.
- Update the working directory to match the target branch or commit.

### `kit merge`
- Merge changes from one branch into another.
- Handle conflicts during the merge process.

### `kit reset`
- Reset the repository to a specific commit.
- Support soft, mixed, and hard resets.

### `kit diff`
- Show differences between:
  - The working directory and the last commit.
  - Two specific commits.
- Highlight added, modified, and deleted lines.
